This little demo app is called **Nazara** — and it started with curiosity.

I saw a beautifully crafted app with a very unique interaction and thought:
> “I need to understand how this works on a deeper level.”

So yes — Nazara is inspired by (and copied from) an existing open-source app.
No hiding it. No pretending.
Just **learning by doing**.

## In this demo:

- I experimented with three onboarding screens using image masks
- Built a simple gallery screen
- Showcased 25 photos of Pakistan in a 5×5 grid
- Fully swipeable in all directions — because exploring should feel free 🇵🇰✨

That’s it.
No features. No business logic.
Just curiosity, exploration, and Flutter.

I truly believe rebuilding open-source projects (with honesty and credit) is one of the fastest ways to grow as a developer.

So if anyone asks, “Is this copied?”
**Yes — and I already said it proudly 😄**
